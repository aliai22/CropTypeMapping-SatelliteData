# Crop Type Mapping Using Transfer Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a transfer learning-based approach for crop type mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery. The project involves training a U-Net segmentation model (pretrained on ImageNet with InceptionResNetV2 backbone) on CORINE land cover data for rice crop classification. The trained model was applied to a local region (Sargodha, Pakistan) for predicting rice field locations using manually prepared labels based on vegetation indices like NDVI.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Use satellite imagery and deep learning for automated crop type mapping to produce moderately accurate crop maps in label scarced regions as a starting point.
- **Datasets:**
    - ***Training:*** Rice crop maps extracted from *CORINE* land cover data.
    - ***Application:*** Sentinel-2 imagery of rice fields in Sargodha region, manually labeled using NDVI.
- **Methods:**
    - U-Net architecture with *InceptionResNetV2* backbone.
    - Transfer learning for semantic segmentation.
- **Results:**
    - Moderately accurate rice crop maps.
    - Visual comparison of predicted masks and ground truth labels.
